In simple words, it measures producer's capability to produce a product within customer's tolerance range. When a large amount of data is to be evaluated, one takes the help of statistics. It is known that when the variation in the data is due to common causes only, the frequency distribution is a bell curve and from that various attributes are arrived at for evaluation. Retooling Ourselves for the Work from Home Era An interesting tool that has used by successful businesses that continue to do well in their digitized avatar is customer journey mapping. A customer journey map is the realistic story of your customer’s experience across the various touchpoints as he interacts with you while he learns about you and your offerings, compares you with his alternate choices, buys from you and uses your products and services. The outcomes from the journey map must Comparison of Box Guideways vs Linear Motion Guideways for Machine Tool Applications The four main issues associated with the selection of either box guideways or linear motion guideways are speed, rigidity, load carrying capacity and tool life. CNC machines which are built with Box guideways are rigid, a bit slower and capable of taking heavy cuts on large parts. On the other hand, machines built with linear motion guideways are faster but more suitable for lighter-duty applications.  The rule of thumb for the selection between the two is to study the intended application. The decision should be made after answering the following questions. Unmatched Services - The Advantage of Comprehensive Post-Sale Services Finding complete, comprehensive post-sale service is a much-needed relief for shop owners as there is a lot that needs to be done to maintain levels of productivity up to par. Life cycle services to meet your productivity, quality & delivery at a competitive cost- through automation, upgrades, maintaining accuracies, safety & environmental compliances requirements. Upgrading ROI through CNC Machine Upgrades High prices for new large and medium size CNC machines make it difficult for end user to reap the benefits of CNC technology. One of the solutions can be through upgrades.

The method involves addition of new systems or features to enhance the capability of an existing machine tool. The purpose of upgrades and retrofitment are to bring older or existing models up to ideal production goals. Why You Need Automation on your Shop Floor Automation is the inevitable future of manufacturing. While some misconceptions about the technology are stopping the faster adaptation of it, the benefits provide a unanimous verdict on how much it elevates the business of metal cutting. From everyday commodities to machine tools, buying locally/domestically made products are a great decision. Will buying Indian made Products make a Difference? With the growing animosity towards foreign-made products, especially Chinese, over the Pandemic, the “Buy Locally” movement has taken steam. There is a lingering feeling within people that the future is uncertain: keeping their country’s economy going by buying domestically made products from local manufacturers seems to be the popular opinion. But does buying locally support the economy? Is your Machine Tool within Tolerance? Be sure with Laser Calibration How do you document that your CNC machine tool is within tolerance? Ball bar or laser calibration services, the bottom line is your machine tool needs to be regularly screened and corrected to expect dependable performance from your machine tools.

Machine tools need to maintain a standard of precision and accuracy for consistent production. With time and wear, machine tools are bound to develop discrepancies inaccuracy. According to a study by the National Centre of manufacturing sciences, the machine tool itself accounts for 40% of all part quality problems. Correcting these will cut down accuracy and part quality problem significantly. Let us Spare you the Trouble-Spares Support from MMT In a fast-paced industry like ours, it is where every minute of downtime is a loss of productivity, it becomes very important to have timely delivery of spares and we cannot stress enough about the importance of ensuring the spares procured are Genuine. With our widespread network across the county and a team of dedicated personnel, we ensure your spares are handled and delivered swiftly and reliably while ensuring only genuine spares are sourced. Post Lockdown Trends in Manufacturing The government recently announced its intention to spend almost 10 per cent of India's gross domestic product (GDP) in the fiscal year 2020 on economic relief measures.While a lot has been experienced and said about the COVID-19 situation on businesses, what are the real implications facing the economy post-lock-down in India? A Whole New Level in Machine Tools Servicing AceMicromatic Group is a comprehensive machine tools solution provider offering a range of turning centres, milling machines, grinding machines along with 150+ other solutions in the metal forming world. When Micromatic Machine tools (MMT) was started in 1987, the aim was to centralise the marketing and service needs of the group, but with growing sales was a need for a systematic approach to post-sales services. Top 7 Misconceptions about Automation Automation is the most talked-about term of the decade in manufacturing. While it might seem like this means it has been adopted in most manufacturing facilities, that is not the case. There is still some hesitation and misconception around its adaptation. Here are some of the most common reasons for why manufacturers dismiss automation. Twin spindle - One Machine that can do Twice the Job In a manufacturing facility that has fixed floor space, staff size and running on multiple shifts increasing production is a puzzle that cannot be solved by adding multiple machines. A twin-spindle machine would be the right solution? Maintaining high productivity is the key to successfully utilizing your facility. Especially in setup’s where churning out high volumes investing in a twin-spindle machine can be a game-changer for your shop floor. How Is 3D Printing Winning Big in the Healthcare Industry in the Current Situation 3D printing has become a buzzword in recent times, but it is a decade old technology that has been rapidly evolving. 3D printing presents many new possibilities to the world of manufacturing. In the medical world, application for additive manufacturing has seen the highest demand. From implants to prosthetics and making personalized or even patented intricate designs, additive manufacturing has the solution. 7 Major Impacts Industry 4.0 has on the Manufacturing Industry Industrial revolutions in the past have brought massive changes in manufacturing. After three major industrial revolutions, the fourth one has arrived and has the potential to intensify the manufacturing process even further with the help of technology and the internet. Industry 4.0 leverages concepts like IoT, AI, and machine learning to expand and enhance the manufacturing field. Do not Overlook Reconditioning. It can save you a lot of Money! Wear and tear due to age, accidents, and breakdowns of machine tools are common occurrences at a manufacturing unit like a shop floor. This increases maintenance cost and affects production causing a huge dent in finances. Keeping the current production volumes in mind, buying a new machine is a serious investment that requires a lot of recovery time. With an industry where capital investment is huge, it seems like there are very few options to choose from as a solution. 10 Reasons to Consider Indian Machine Tools Over Imports When India began to manufacture in the 1950s finding machines capable of doing such tough metal cutting was only possible through foreign machine tools. Slowly around the 1970s Indian manufacturers began to make machine tools that were suitable for the Indian manufacturing requirements. 8 Things You Should Look for While Selecting Your CNC Manufacturer? Choosing the right CNC machine tool manufacturer for your production needs is one of the most important decisions of your business. There are many options to choose from but how do you make the right decision from the ones that are suggested? How do you find manufacturers who offer quality, performance, reliability, lower price? Do you go with the expensive manufacturers, and reputed ones? To get a better idea of how to choose the right manufacturer for your shop floor, think about the below points for better clarity: 6 Reasons why an AMC is the Best Thing for your Shop Floor Today, any business is dependent on technology for a consistent flow in its operation. A small disruption could have a domino effect on the whole system. In the metal cutting industry, CNC machines are typically required to perform nonstop from the time they are commissioned.

With factories shut and virtually no production, manufacturing companies had no choice but to work out a solution through remote working also known as the work-from-home model. But with more than 60% of their workforce belonging to physical work, challenges were aplenty for manufacturers. How is digital transformation changing the manufacturing industry in uncertain times? The pandemic COVID-19 has disrupted the world. What is unique is that it has happened at the same time across all lives and livelihoods. The IT sector has already been advocating a digitization strategy across all businesses which has helped them continue with their processes despite restrictions. Whereas, with manufacturing companies, the challenges are bigger and require faster adoption strategies. The biggest manufacturing trends created by COVID 19 The impact of the Novel Coronavirus is so significant that globally, some major shifts and trends seem to have emerged. Here is a list of changes for better or for worse.
The effects of the virus have created panic within people causing changes in their commuting behaviors. A global survey done by Cars.com with over 3,000 men and women between the ages of 23 and 73 years of age in March suggests that over 40% of them have stopped using ride-sharing modes like Uber and Lyft.

Scale your Decentralized app in 30 mins. 400+ Dapp already have scaled their performance Get started Contact Us Built by developers, for developers Polygon combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains into a full-fledged multi-chain system. Polygon solves pain points associated with Blockchains, like high gas fees and slow speeds, without sacrificing on security. This multi-chain system is akin to other ones such as Polkadot, Cosmos, Avalanche etc, but with at least three major upsides: It is able to fully benefit from Ethereum’s network effects It is inherently more secure It is more open and powerful Challenge Ethereum is the blockchain development platform of choice, but it has limitations. Low Throughput Poor UX (gas, delayed PoW finality) No sovereignty (shared throughput/clogging risk, tech stack not customizable, governance dependence) Many projects are exploring Ethereum-compatible blockchains as a way to mitigate these limitations while still leveraging Ethereum’s thriving ecosystem. However, there is no specialized framework to build such blockchains nor a protocol to connect them. This introduces significant development challenges and causes ecosystem fragmentation.

Pure silk is natural and eco-friendly, which emantes from the silk worm. The scientific work for invention of cheap mitation of Natural silk may be in progress, but in the market place there are numerous other textile materials sold in the name of silk i.e. Art silk, Artificial silk and other glamorous names. A layman's test for identifying pure silk is the 'Burning Test' which can be carried out at any place and at any time. Hundres percent silk means both the warp and weft should be made from pure silk yarns. To carry out the simple test, take out a small piece of thread from both directions and burn it. Pure silk will give the smell of burning hair and will leave a black residue, which can be easily crushed to powder by the finger. TAKING CARE OF SILK Precautions during washing Always wash silks in soft water. Add a pinch of Borax or Ammonia, if water is hard. Use a good neutral soap in the form of either flakes or solution. Light detergent may also be used in the case of hard water. Wash in lukewarm water by kneading & squeezing or suction. Rinse in warm water 2-3 times to remove traces of soap. Add a few drops of citric acid or acetic acid to the final rinse in cold water. Silk with doubtful colour fastness may be steeped in cold water with a small amount of citric or acetic acid for 1-2 minutes before washing. Squeeze lightly by hand to remove excess water. Always dry flat, in shade. Precautions during ironing Use low to medium heat. Never spray water to dampen silk before ironing. This will cause water spot on the fabric. Silk should be always ironed on the reverse side if still dampen. Precautions during storing Store your silks in a clean and dry environment. If storage is prolonged, periodic airing and brushing is advisable. Protect silk from insects, dust, excessive moisture and light. Avoid direct contact with wood. Wrap zari sarees in cotton cloth to avoid discolouring of zari. Keep silica sachets in racks.

Visible Results Visible Results The best way for us to be there is not to be there: By being almost invisible, only an efficient background noise that keeps things moving at the pace, and in the direction, of your liking.Creating results that speak for themselves. Container & Cargo handling All types of cargoes (agro, machinery, heavy lifts, chemicals, foodstuff, grains, steel, project cargoes, hazardous goods etc)  are handled for stuffing into containers, destuffing from import containers, clearing cargoes and transporting. Cargoes requiring special focus - surveys, fumigation, testing, approvals , bar-coding, packinging, shrink-wrapping, weighments, and Large and over-dimensional cargoes are handled deftly and in a manner which befits that type. Rail Terminal (EXIM and Domestic) Navkar CFS has a Private Freight Terminal (PFT) at its facility. Large amounts of agro commodi ties (rice, sugar, wheat, maize, soya bean meal, steel coils, ingots etc) arrive in rakes comprising BCN wagons for exports. These are discharged from rakes and stuffed into containers and moved to the port. Navkar CFS also operates container trains between JNPT Port and Navkar CFS for export and import containers. Rail movement gives the added value of extra free days of storage in port. Navkar also has a rail siding for domestic movement of cargoes to distant inland destinations. CFS For Handling Hazardous Cargo Two of the three CFSs of Navkar, have been duly approved by the Customs Department for storing and handling hazardous cargoes. All categories of hazardous cargoes which areclassed in the International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code can be handled at Navkar II container freight station. Hazardous goods require continuous surveillance with constant monitoring capability supported by fire-fighting arrangements for emergencies. Navkar has all of it with a specially trained team to oversee these special and specific requirements. Reefer Containers All refrigerated containers (reefers) are handled at our CFSs. With 92 plug points reefer cargoes are regularly stuffed for export as well as destuffed for clearance by consignees. Temperate-controlled cargoes are stored in cold chambers at our CFS and cleared for exports and imports as required. To and fro movement between port and CFS is carried out on trailers fitted with power-packs so as to ensure maintenance of set temperatures. Bonded Warehouse Import shipments occasionally require cargoes to be bonded and thereafter to be cleared in either small parcels or in entirety. These are kept in our  bonded warehouses. Importers have the facility of keeping their imported goods without paying customs duty for a period of time as regulated by the Customs Department and clearing them for their use at intervals where deemed fit. Non-bonded warehouse,space for consolidation of LCL cargoes is also available. Surveys, fumigation, packing, labelling and all related activities can be carried out at the warehouses. M&R Navkar carries out repairs to all types of containers.  Every container is meticulously inspected and surveyed and directives as issued by the container shipping  lines are strictly adhered to the equipment of the Lines are maintained to highest standards. Washing, cleaning and removal of debris, left-overs, old stickers is carried out to get the containers ready for the next cargo. Infrastructure Our three container freight stations (CFS) cater to the gateway port of Nhava Sheva (Jawaharlal Nehru Port- JNPT). Spread over an area of 3.59m sq.ft and a capacity of 310,000 TEUs p.a., our CFSs have a back up of 513 trailers, 32 forklifts and 21 Reach- stackers. All operations are closely monitored by closed-circuit television cameras and all events recorded and records maintained. The latest EDI connectivity along with high levels of IT capability in all operations ensures that our state-of-the-art infrastructure delivers what is needed to the customer. Project Cargoes Cargoes arriving for projects are rarely uniform in size or shape. They tend to stretch the dimensional capability of every point in the infrastructure - be it roads or bridges as Navkar is well-equipped to manage all such Over-Dimensional Cargoes (ODC) and Out-of-Gauge (OOG) cargoes Buffer Yard & Supply Chain A large amount of exports are stuffed at the factories and sealed thereafter by the Excise Inspector at the stuffing point. The documentation of such export laden containers are required to be checked and  processed prior to being permitted for loading onto a ship. This documentary requirement, without the need to open the container for any  further inspections or examination, can be carried out at our Buffer Yard in the CFS.  It is a convenient facility for many exporters who prefer bringing their boxes from different locations at different times and...saving time and transportation costs. Hub and Spoke Our efficient logistics environment is leveraged by a number of our clients. Many companies involved in exporting and importing cargoes use Navkar CFS (as a hub) in the hub-and-spoke concept to facilitate efficiencies in their supply chain. In this system, they keep dropping off their  export cargoes at Navkar CFS (hub) for sorting and exporting to different destinations along the 'spokes'. This results in optimizing the utility of their transport and gaining efficiency in the supply chain. Customs, Plant & Quarantine Facility Our aim is always to bring together all requirements at an efficient intersect to ensure logistical efficiencies. Navkar CFS has a complete customs facility for examining and clearance of cargoes. Not only customs, at Navkar CFS the Plant and Quarantine authorities have set up a unit for inspection and approval of agro cargoes and food products which is a statutory requirement for imports and exports of such nature. As these are mostly of perishable nature, on-site approvals are of vital importance. Empty Container Storage Navkar CFS has the added facility of an Empty Container Depot that can store a large number of empty containers. All container shipping lines have a requirement for storage of empty  containers, which when coupled with a  ""Maintenance & Repair"" set-up assists them for a quick turnaround of their containers. The Empty Container Depot has been made contiguous with the Container Freight Station on paved land thereby ensuring that the stored containers are on firm hard and even ground without being unnecessarily stressed or distorted.

Our Team SUPRIYA UCHIL Director, Small Business ""I joined the Small Business vertical in Dec 2018 with the goal to improve the client experience and performance for the small and medium businesses at Delhivery. Having worked in both MNCs as well as Start-ups earlier, Delhivery has been a refreshing change with a good mix of both worlds as one gets the freedom to take on new challenges and think out of the box for solutions while also having processes to guide you and a very accessible leadership to support you. Over the last few months, the Small Business vertical has managed to take bigger strides with new processes and product automation to make the end to end process for a client from onboarding to shipping more seamless and efficient."" VIKAS KAPOOR Head, Global Operations ""I have always had a strong entrepreneurial streak, and the process of building something from scratch has always excited me. I joined Delhivery in 2012 as one of the first team members. At Delhivery, I have built our first fulfilment center, scaled our entire partner program for alternate delivery and distribution, and now run the entire cross-border business vertical. Dealing with ambiguity daily and refining the problem statement to provide a clearer vision for my team is the biggest challenge. This is what keeps me going as we carve out our success story."" PRIYANKA UTKARSHA Director, Analytics ""I joined Delhivery in 2016 to manage fulfilment analytics. In the last five years, I have got the opportunity to work on multiple projects that have strengthened my data-driven decision-making capabilities. Currently, I head the supply chain analytics for enterprise solutions group, where we study the supply chain flow for our clients to design an efficient and optimised network flow to reduce cost and time to market. I have been fortunate to be a part of a culture that promotes kinship, open communication, and trust. We are a team of highly motivated and dynamic bootstrappers, and working with such go-getters has been a fun rollercoaster ride."" Sahil Sachdeva Senior Manager, Sales ""I joined Delhivery as a Manager in the Business Development team. When we started, our initial focus was to get more accounts into the system by getting in touch with all the fashion groups. Today, I am responsible for developing category-specific strategy, client management, and monitoring tools and procedures; while ensuring operational efficiency so that things get delivered on time, every time, especially on the B2C and Partial-Truckload services. I work with a bunch of people with an amazing drive to work and energy that is truly infectious. The Delhivery culture and leadership inspire me to work hard and to stay challenged every day."" Don John Thomas Senior Director, Sales ""I joined Delhivery in 2015 after several years at FedEx and currently lead the P&L for the South region. I have enjoyed building a team from scratch, keeping them focused, motivated, and aligned with our vision of leadership in the supply chain space. I have enjoyed working with a young team but also being able to leverage my experience and build a sustainable business from almost zero. The fact that every little thing we do adds up to the revolution in the logistics space is extremely gratifying for me. Delhivery gives you the opportunity to drive an initiative with complete ownership, freedom to make mistakes and learn from them."" Mithun Chakraborty Senior Director, Last Mile Operations ""I joined Delhivery in 2014. The thing I appreciate the most about the company is that it has given me the opportunity to work in a fast, challenging, yet pleasant multicultural environment. My journey has been filled with learning and growing within the organization. My hunger to learn has helped me progress from a Field Executive to a Senior Director that clearly shows that Delhivery encourages you to have a voice in your team no matter who you are."" HUNNY GHADE Senior Director, Operations ""I have been associated with Delhivery since 2012. I have set up the Express operations and have been part of every significant phase of setting up our National Transportation network. I have also worked on system direction and process improvement products in the Technology team. Currently, I am heading the Operations of our Delhivery Freight business (FTL). Delhivery has always been an employee-friendly organisation providing a conducive environment for all the employees to grow and learn new things."" Priyanka Rawat Manager, Project Execution ""I started my career as a Customer Support Executive at Delhivery in 2014, where I learned a lot about the process and structure of the overall support function. Post that, I moved to the Control Tower team in 2016, where I was a part of projects related to service level improvements for B2B and B2C functions. This gave me a 360-degree view of the vertical that later helped me set up a separate CT team for E2E customers. I have had various opportunities to build my career and understand cross-functional operations, which helped me gain experience and sharpen my skill set.

Some of our significant projects were: Forwarding freight from Scotland to Mumbai for a manufacturing giant Our team arranged a pickup in Scotland, managed the repacking for airworthy carriage efficiently, completed customs clearance and handed over the consignment to the airline – all within a day! The consignment arrived in Mumbai in due time. From the shipper’s factory in Scotland to the Mumbai airport, we had managed the delivery within a span of two days. Cargo transportation from Chennai to France We were required to transport 175 tonnes of cargo in six days. The pandemic created enormous challenges – from the flights being cancelled and freighters being grounded for 20 days, creating a huge backlog of cargo and an increase in the freight rate. Despite these obstacles, our team diligently carried out the operations, meeting the deadline, that too at the agreed bid rate. We ensured door-to-door movement and delivered 80% of the material at the right time, helping our customer meet set targets within a record time of five days.

I first took loan from Mahindra Finance in 2013 which turned out to be very convenient for me as compared to the banks. Less documentation and disbursement is very fast. Even when I failed to pay an EMI on time, they would send an executive to visit our place to collect EMI. The staff is friendly to deal with. Because of all this, I took a loan again in 2016. I have repaid both the loans I have taken and now I am planning to take a third one from them. Ranjeev Ranjan Patliputra (Bihar) I was looking out for options to take a loan for a pre-owned WagonR. I came to know about Mahindra Finance from an acquaintance. Mahindra Finance was clearly more feasible option financially so I went ahead with it. I am fully satisfied with the products and service quality that Mahindra Finance provides. If I have any more loan requirement, I will definitely go with Mahindra Finance. Kundan Kumar Muzaffarpur (Bihar) I come from an agricultural background; I shared my thought of buying a tractor with my friend. He, being the existing customer of Mahindra Finance, referred me to the company for a tractor loan. The team immediately disbursed the loan amount and I got my tractor within a week. With the help of the tractor my income level has improved. I ensure promptness in my repayment. I am also planning to buy another tractor in the coming year and I will definitely prefer Mahindra Finance for the same.

The Check in counter was handled by smiling staff and it was fast. The Room size was decent with all the necessities readily available. And then the best part: had read in some review about the Breakfast, but all my fears were laid to rest. A very good spread : you think of it and it was there. The staff were attentive and fast to serve. Another plus plus is the Location- a metro station as good as attached to the hotel. Plenty of eating options also available within 1-2 kms: what more does one aspire for. Vijay kumar sharma Aurangabad, India I stayed for 2 nights in this hotel last week and my experience was excellent in every way. Clean, large and hygienic rooms, good house keeping staff and room service, excellent ambiance and high quality breakfast impressed me. Located centrally within reach of important city landmarks and business places, its very accessible. The reception and staff are very helpful. The choice of toiletries in the room are great and overall, this was one of my best stays in Mumbai. Would like to reconsider this hotel during my next visits. Shreenivas S Bengaluru, India This property hold good for business travelers as well as for family visits. Located just next to Chakala Metro Station, it has an advantage for travelers in commuting although they have ample parking space. The rooms are good and service is very prompt.The Breakfast had quite a spread and the hotel had a busy lobby and conference rooms which is evident that it is one of the popular properties for business gatherings.

But others are so filled with inner riches, they defy easy description. For our guests, this has always posed a challenge: How to best capture the world of luxury that
                        is The Leela? For one visitor, it's a lobby – and a welcome that makes her feel like royalty. For another, it's discovering a hidden garden, guided only by the scent of jasmine. To some, it is small touches that few others notice
                        – the warmth of a gesture, the extra care in the simplest dish. Finding the right words for this distinctly Indian brand of luxury is made all the more difficult because it is constantly being refined and enhanced by each person
                        we invite to join our staff. From the start, we have been on a continuous journey to delight each traveller who crosses our threshold. It is The Leela's goal to provide the most demanding guests with memorable, magical stays that deliver the essence of India and discover a 5-Star
                        experience found only in India, and only at The Leela. In a span of 30 years, The Leela Palaces, Hotels and Resorts has grown to comprise a world-class collection of nine award-winning luxury hotels spread across key destinations
                        in India with many more on the anvil Presently since 17th October 2019 after its Financial restructuring HLV Ltd has The Leela Mumbai Hotel to render its further expansion plans into the future. Early Years The Leela story begins with its founder Late Capt. CP Krishnan Nair, and a deep hunger that fuelled his ambitions. Born into a poor agricultural family in Kannur District of Kerala, India, Capt. Nair joined the Free India Army in his mid-20s. He met Leela,
                                the daughter of a successful handloom owner, who went on to become his soulmate, a life-partner and the leading lady in all his business ventures. After marriage, he resigned from the Army in 1945 and joined the handloom
                                business, working his charm into the handloom industry, the world over. Capt. CP Krishnan Nair took over as the CEO of the Producers-cum-Consumers Cooperative Society in Malabar, where the handloom industry was going through troubled times. Convinced that India had lost much of its arts and crafts
                                in weaving during the colonization period, Capt. Nair prioritized the revitalizing of the dying handloom textile industry in the country. In 1951, he started the Leela Lace, a company that pioneered the fabric called 'Bleeding

                                Lauren. Soon, his business grew. And as Capt. Nair's travels increased, so did his exposure to some of the most hospitable and luxurious hotels of the world. He was greatly impressed by the high standards of hospitality
                                at some of the iconic hotels of that time. During several interactions with General Managers of these hotels who would host him over lavish meals, he understood the finer nuances of what it took to make a luxury hotel. Early Years The Leela story begins with its founder Late Capt. CP Krishnan Nair, and a deep hunger that fuelled his ambitions. Born into a poor agricultural family in Kannur District of Kerala, India, Capt. Nair joined the Free India Army in his mid-20s. He met Leela,
                                the daughter of a successful handloom owner, who went on to become his soulmate, a life-partner and the leading lady in all his business ventures. After marriage, he resigned from the Army in 1945 and joined the handloom
                                business, working his charm into the handloom industry, the world over. Capt. CP Krishnan Nair took over as the CEO of the Producers-cum-Consumers Cooperative Society in Malabar, where the handloom industry was going through troubled times. Convinced that India had lost much of its arts and crafts
                                in weaving during the colonization period, Capt. Nair prioritized the revitalizing of the dying handloom textile industry in the country. In 1951, he started the Leela Lace, a company that pioneered the fabric called ‘Bleeding
                                Madras', which went on to become one of the most sought after material in USA. He engaged with the best in the business and the long list of coveted clients included designers such as Liz Claiborne, Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph
                                Lauren. Soon, his business grew. And as Capt. Nair's travels increased, so did his exposure to some of the most hospitable and luxurious hotels of the world. He was greatly impressed by the high standards of hospitality
                                at some of the iconic hotels of that time. During several interactions with General Managers of these hotels who would host him over lavish meals, he understood the finer nuances of what it took to make a luxury hotel. The Leela Mumbai opens in 1986 When actively scouting for land in Mumbai to construct his first hotel, he and his wife stumbled upon a vast tract of 11 acres situated close to the international airport. There was no other commercial establishment around it, except for a taxi stand
                                that catered to travellers arriving at the airport. His wife Leela's deep instincts that travellers to the airport would need a place to stay, prompted him to take up the challenge of building a luxury hotel without conducting
                                a market survey.Till date there is no other hotel in the precincts of Mumbai that is situated as expansively as The Leela Mumbai. At 64 years of age, when most people decide to rest on their laurels, Capt. Nair worked tirelessly to commission his first hotel in a record time of less than three years. A far-sighted and an avid marketer, he knew that he needed the brand to be marketed
                                overseas. He tied-up with the Penta group, a subsidiary of Lufthansa for a marketing franchise. The Leela Penta in 1986. When Kempinski bought over the Penta group, the marketing franchise continued and the hotel was renamed
                                The Leela Kempinski. Since 2013, the hotel has been rechristened The Leela Mumbai. Within three years of opening, The Leela Mumbai won the National Tourism Award for being the highest grossing foreign exchange earner. The

                                India that would provide an ideal tropical escape from the harsh winters of Europe. His foresight led him to establishing the most captivating resort tucked away on the southern tip of Goa, set amidst 75 acres of landscaped
                                gardens. Sprawled between the Arabian Sea and River Sal, the resort has been designed by the renowned architect, Tom Pugliaso, and it reflects the Portuguese and Indian heritage. The resort has 206 luxuriously appointed guestrooms and

For our members, our colleagues, our partners, and for every life we touch. How do we do this? By dealing in the currency of laughter and smiles. And in making the most of the moments that are given to us, and the moments we create for each other. We create memorable holidays in the most popular resorts, drawing from our journal of holiday destinations in India and international holidays. You will find us nestled in hills, lounging on coasts, tucked away in forests and basking under the desert sun. Our family resorts ensure that customers have access to happiness, freedom, excitement, adventure, romance and entertainment. Our resorts for kids enable a whole new kind of education, one that is tested in grazed knees, sticky hands, sandy toes and dripping chins. Our kid-friendly resorts offer a host of exciting activities that parent-children duos can partake in, including aqua zorbing, fish dancing and ziplining. Our family resorts also provide a platform for kids to don different avatars. You can watch your children play MasterChef, as they whip up delicious treats. Or perhaps, marvel at their creativity as they craft intricate and colourful puppets. Is it any wonder that kids absolutely love it here? Family vacations with Club Mahindra mean more than recreation and sight-seeing holidays. They mean taking home an album of extraordinary memories to be cherished for a lifetime. Because, memories begin here. With us. At Club Mahindra.

The moment we reached here we indulged in many indoor and outdoor activities and it was excellent. We enjoyed everything at affordable prices. I am going to recommend my friends to visit Jade resort. Country Club is the best !!!. Karthik Chennai, Tamilnadu We visited Country Club Valley Vista for three days. The stay was very good. The staff were very professional, helpful and courteous. Apart from that, the resort is located at outskirts of the city, providing a calm and serene environment which you will never find anywhere else. In short, we enjoyed a lot at Country Club. Ravi Choraria Bangalore, Karnataka I have visited Country Club Chanakyapuri, Kolkata. The place is well designed with luxurious amenities.

I am going to recommend my friends to visit the Country Club Chanakyapuri. Sumit Basu Sunderbans, West Bengal We heard a lot about Country Club Bandipur, so we visited there with family. To be frank,we enjoyed one week stay to the fullest, the staff was very polite and cordial. They made sure that we enjoyed our vacation without any hindrance. Abhinav Delhi We came from Abu Dhabi and stayed at Country Club Valley Vista- Kodaikanal. We stayed here for 6 nights & 7 days and trust me the entire hotel team and staff members didn’t disappoint us. They not only met our expectations but exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed our vacation from the bottom of our heart and now feeling sad to bid goodbye. We really don't want to go back. It was a rejuvenating vacation for us. Sai Kumar Abu Dhabi I have been a Country Club member for 3 years. This time I have arranged my wife’s Baby shower at Country Club. The immense support that is provided by the staff in arranging all the stuff for the ceremony and decorations was splendid.

N. Chaudhary. Established less than a decade ago, our organisation takes immense pride in having retained all of our clients over the last five years. Additionally, we have managed to retain more than 80 percent of our staff during this period.

SSLLPG were the pioneer in the field of LPG marketing and established large integrated infrastructure to carry LPG from dock (Port) to the door of customers, which consisted of dedicated port facilities, large storage terminals, network of bottling plants and distribution and marketing networks. The company was able to do well from the commencement of commercial operations in 1995 till 1999 and became profitable. Infact the company emerged as the country's largest private sector LPG company. However, due to abnormal rise in crude oil prices during 1999 to 2000, the international LPG prices also shot up. Despite the big spurt in sourcing cost, it was not possible to proportionately increase the prices due to competition with the Government Subsidized gas by virtue of which the company incurred losses. This was further aggravated in the subsequent years due to the growing disparity in the prices between the private LPG operators and the PSU Oil Undertakings, on account of non-removal of subsidy as promised by the Government of India (GOI). The GOI did not honour its commitments to withdraw subsidy in a phased manner which led to the crisis in Private Sector LPG Industry. Because the company's dedicated customer base was much larger, it had to suffer greater losses as more sales meant more losses. Inspite of the difficult times, the company built a strong brand image viz SHAKTI GAS which is still quite popular. The company's proposed plan for diversification into solar power generation did not materialize due to continuous decline in the prices of solar power which made the project uncertain and un-remunerative. The size of Projects have gone up steeply involving large funds. It is also noted that gestation period to realize profits is substantial and may not be suitable to the Company as of now. The management is of the opinion that the hospitality Industry is one area with lot of potential particularly in the States of AP and Telangana. The management is also evaluating various other options including foray into the hospitality industry. The objects clause of the company is so made out as to cover the wide range of activities to enable the company to consider embarking upon new projects and activities considered to be convenient, advantageous and feasible for the company's business and also to seize the opportunity available in hospitality segment. In view of the proposed expansion and diversification into the hospitality business the company has changed its name to Sri Havisha Hospitality and Infrastructure Ltd (SHHIL).

Efficient. Drop by drop. The Digital Enterprise portfolio for the water and waste water industry. Water is the most valuable resource on our planet. That’s why efficiency and quality are top priorities for the water industry. These goals are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as the expense of providing clean water grows in many regions, while at the same time operations have to be as efficient and economical as possible. The consistent, end-to-end digitalization of plants and processes helps the water and waste water industry meet these challenges. Our water and waste water industry experts will be happy to advise you Contact us Digital Enterprise Digitalization throughout the water cycle To enable the water industry to get the most from digitalization, Siemens developed the Digital Enterprise, a comprehensive portfolio of software and automation solutions. Processing all available data in a comprehensive data model makes it possible to optimally exploit the full potential of all systems. The result is a digital twin – a precise, virtual model of the plant that’s always up-to-date. Benefits for greenfield and brownfield plants The intelligent linking of data from different sources like sensors, water meters, and weather data is creating new opportunities to use water more efficiently – and therefore more sustainably – in industry, agriculture, and municipal utilities. A precondition is the end-to-end networking of system engineering, from commissioning to operation, maintenance, and ongoing process optimization based on a data platform – a merging of the virtual and real worlds. The improved data quality and availability reduce project execution time in the real world. At the same time, the possibilities offered by simulation and modeling in the virtual world reduce both incalculable costs during the construction phase and ongoing operating costs. The digital twin for greenfield plants Reaching your goals faster and more effectively When greenfield plants are being planned, the combination of data from plant engineering and automation planning enables parallel work processes and sequences. This reduces the duration of the project while at the same time improving its quality. Thanks to the integration of planning, engineering, and operation, the data acquired during the operating phase can be reused for engineering and supplemented with the latest operating data. The automatic updates to planning data during plant operation make it possible to always keep the actual condition of plants and systems in view when performing service and modernizations and to implement projects efficiently and effectively. The digital twin for brownfield plants Systematically updated Because their planning data is often unavailable in digital form or is incomplete or outdated, brownfield plants can benefit from digitalization. With the appropriate tools, even large and unstructured datasets can be read into a uniform database structure and verified. In addition, by integrating 2D and 3D data using appropriate tools, plants can be digitalized and linked to imported planning data in a database structure. This is how the data can be verified and plant operators can obtain an up-to-date digital model of their plant.
